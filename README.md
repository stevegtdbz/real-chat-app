# Real-Time-Chat-App
A simple web app for real time chat messages!
Written in php / mysql / jquery / bootstrap.

# How it works
There is a php server that handles all client's connections.
It uses socket programming to offer real time messaging experience between the clients.
All messages are also saved to a mysql database in order to be accesible at any time.
